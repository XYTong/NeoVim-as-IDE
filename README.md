# NeoVim-as-IDE
After the official version of Neovim 0.5.x was launched, LSP (Language Server Protocol) was built in, and the code prompt experience has been on par with VSCode. Lua has become the first-class language of the editor, and the configuration is easier to understand. Many VIM plug-ins have Lua native versions, and the configuration is not so hard-core, making Vim more modern and easier to use.
